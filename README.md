Book theme
===

Hello, friends!
Iâ€™ve found this website mock-up in Figma community. And I liked it so much so decided to make a WordPress theme from it. This theme is responsive and adapted for mobile devices. I used such features like source set for images. And in result we have very fast loading WordPress theme. I started using underscores starter theme.
